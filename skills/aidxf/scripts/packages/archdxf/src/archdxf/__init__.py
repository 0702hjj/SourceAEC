"""archdxf: architectural DXF drafting primitives (self-written, ezdxf-based).

Drawing-construction layer for aidxfv3 gen_dxf() sources: wall frames,
opening subtraction, door/window symbols, fixtures, annotation chains.
Design decisions (where walls are, what openings exist) stay with the
caller; this library only expands declarations into standard drafting.
