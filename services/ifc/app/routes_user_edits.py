"""User-edit parsing: diff an externally modified IFC upload, and append
USER-annotated modification events to the model's change log.

These endpoints back the platform MCP server (W-0018): a user edits an IFC
(or DXF) outside the platform, and the platform needs a structured,
provenance-annotated record of what the user changed.

``POST .../diff/upload`` diffs the uploaded IFC against the current model
state with the same flat GlobalId-keyed schema as ``POST .../diff`` plus a
``labels`` map (human-readable name/type per guid; labels for removed
elements come from the base file). Nothing is persisted and nothing is
cached (the uploads file is mutable).

``POST .../user-edits`` appends structured user modification events to the
edit history, stamped ``provenance={"source": "USER", "origin": ...}`` and
``operation="upload"`` so AI-generated and UI edits stay distinguishable
from external user edits.
